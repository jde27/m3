README file for Mathematical Methods 3: notes, question sheets and solutions

Mathematical Methods 3 is a second-year course I taught at UCL in 2012, 2013 and 2014.

------ Notes

The file notes.tex is the master document which pulls together

fourier.tex
sepvar.tex
euler-lagrange.tex
characteristics.tex
notes-texhead.tex

You only need to compile notes.tex (the other files are not
complete TeX source files and will not compile).


------ Question sheets

qun-sheet-texhead.tex is a header file and is included in all question sheets.

qun-sh0.tex was a warm-up sheet (not assessed) to make sure the students
were confident integrating various useful expressions/solving simple
ODEs.

qun-extra.tex was a sheet of more challenging/interesting questions
for students who wanted to be stretched.

The files qun-sh*.tex are the source files for the question and answers.
To generate answers, run the Bash script ans.sh: for example

./ans.sh 3

will generate the answers for sheet 3. It does this by running through
the file qun-sh3.tex and removing all the "\iffalse...\fi" code that
ides the answers. Don't edit the ans3.tex file separately - it is
generated by ./ans.sh and will be overwritten when you run that script.
The purpose of this was to minimise discrepancies between questions as
stated in the question sheets and as stated in the solutions...
